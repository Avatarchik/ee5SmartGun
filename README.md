# Introduction
Bachelor project: VR smartgun sensordata logging system
This was my final bachelor project during my bachelors of Industrial Engineering Technology.

This repo contains all the necessary code for the Arduino's that were used inside the gun. I also included the most important Unity C# scripts for the handling of the UDP connection over WiFi.
